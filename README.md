# Welcome to Szybka Kolejka app #

An innovative approach to Polish public healthcare queueing system.
The app aims to improve the comfort of Polish patients.

# How to run the app? #

You need to:
* download Expo Go app on your phone
* connect your phone to the computer
* download npm to your computer
* enter frontend / helth-fifo directory
* run npx expo start from
* scan the QR code and enjoy the experience!
This is only the demo version so when adding a new queue with QR code you just need to scan any QR (can be the very same that you used to run your expo instance)
